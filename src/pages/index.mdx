#### Attendance

- If there are multiple people with you, use the chat and let us know how many are with you

#### Before and after the meeting

- If possible, consider joining the meeting early and staying after to associate
- Please allow time for any unexpected technical issues

#### Video

- It’s great to have your video on before and after the meeting because it’s encouraging to **see** each other. We might be doing this for weeks, so if we only use audio others might feel disconnected from us
- Consider propping your tablet or mobile phone up on a table or flat surface when sharing video, so your video is stable and looking at you straight-on
- Once the meeting has started, **please turn your video off**

#### Commenting

Sharing in the meeting will be a great encouragement to the congregation! Please don’t be shy or let this new technology keep you from participating.

- **When you would like to comment via the app:**
  - Depending on your device: Select “Participants” or “More”
  - Select “Raise Hand”
  - If you’re called on, the host will unmute you and request to show your video
  - After your comment, the host will mute you, and turn off your video
  - If you are not called on, tap “Lower hand” to put it down
- **Commenting on the phone:**
  - Dial `*9` if you’d like to raise your hand to comment
  - If called upon, the host will unmute you
  - After your comment, the host will mute you again

#### Chat Feature

Feel free to say hello using the chat feature before and after the meeting, but please don’t use it during the meeting.

### When Presenting a Student Assignment

- Before your student assignment begins, please make sure your video is enabled and that you can see your assistant on the screen
