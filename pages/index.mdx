![Zoom Buttons](/img/zoom-buttons.png)

#### Dress

- Dress as if you were attending the meeting

#### Before and after the meeting

- If possible, consider joining the meeting early and staying after to associate
- Please allow time for any unexpected technical issues

#### Video

- It’s great to have your video on before and after the meeting because it’s encouraging to **see** each other. We might be doing this for weeks, so if we only use audio others might feel disconnected from us
- Consider propping your tablet or mobile phone up on a table or flat surface when sharing video, so your video is stable and looking at you straight-on

#### Commenting

Sharing in the meeting will be a great encouragement to the congregation! Please don’t be shy or let this new technology keep you from participating.

- **When you would like to comment via the app:**

  - Depending on your device: Select **“Participants”** or **“More”**
  - Select **“Raise Hand”**
  - When you’re called on, unmute yourself and give your comment
  - After your comment, please lower your hand and put yourself back on mute

- **Commenting on the phone:**
  - Dial `*9` if you’d like to raise your hand to comment

#### Chat Feature

Feel free to say hello using the chat feature before and after the meeting, but please don’t use it during the meeting.

### Presenting a part or demonstration

- Before part begins, please make sure your video is enabled
- When the chairman introduces your part, you should unmute your mic and begin speaking
- If you are instructed to play a video for your part, the audio/video support brother will play the video for you
- When your assignment is completed, please mute yourself

## Field Service Arrangements

Features of our public ministry, including the door-to-door work and public witnessing, are discontinued until further instruction is given. Other forms of witnessing that do not require being in close contact with groups of people, such as letter writing, is encouraged.
